7) `npm run register` to create the vault.json file

8) `npm start` will start the server locally

####config.json and vault.json
See [node-a2p3](https://github.com/dickhardt/node-a2p3) for details

## Deployment to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

1) Decide what hostname you will be using for you Resource Server. Set the `appID` in config.json and rerun `npm run register` to generate a new vault.json if it is different.

2) Add the generated vault.json and config.json files to the local repo so that they will be deployed to AWS:

  git add -f vault.json
  git add -f config.json
  git commit -a -m"add in vault and config"

3) Browse to [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com) and register or login.

4) Get your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key from [Security Credentials](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/securityCredentials)

5) Install and setup the [eb](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/usingCLI.html) CLI tools.

6) `eb init` providing your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key and accept all defaults. Note the sample does not use an external Database, you will need to modify the sample to use one.

7) `eb start` will deply and start your application

8) Configure your DNS or to point your host name to the host at elasticbeanstalk.com where your RS is deployed.

When you make changes, `git aws.push` will upload your local commits to AWS (remember to `git commit -a -m"<commit description here>"`)

Additional documetion on running [Node on Elastic Beanstalk](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_nodejs.html)

##Testing
`npm test` will run the tests

NOTE: see the comments in test/test.js for values you will need to modify to run a test

The server must be running to be tested, and the DB needs to be empty.
Stopping and restarting the server will clear the in-memory DB.

##Database
This sample stores all of its data in an large JSON object. The DB API calls are all have prcoess.nextTick() calls so that it acts async. To have resilient storage, rewrite db_dev.js to expose the same API but work with the database of your choice.
